Scenario is 4-cells which are kept in grid manner with inter-cell distance of 1KM with 30dBM like in NWS Final Assignment.
A) Find out max capacity of the LTE system
1) Place one UE per cell which is very close to respective eNBs, w/o mobility, full buffer with 12 Mbps UDP flow per UE in
Downlink from Remote Host.
2) Plot Time vs SINR for one UE (say UE of cell-1).
3) Plot Time vs Instantaneous throughput for the same UE.
B) For the same above scenario, find the min capacity of the LTE system.
1)Place all 4 UEs at the overlapping region of 4-cells to create max interference scenario.
2) Plot Time vs SINR for one UE (say UE of cell-1).
3)Plot Time vs Instantaneous throughput for the same UE.
